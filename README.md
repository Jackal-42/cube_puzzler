### Notes
v0.0 is finished and plays quite well in my opinion. However, you will most likely find bugs. If you do, report them and please, please try and find a consistent setup and adequate description.<br>
Sometimes, the cube face will "corrupt". This is very rare. You will know if it has happened if some of the tiles on the cube appear a very bright pink, the "undefined" texture. If this happens to you, please try and find a setup.<br>
You may place multiple spawn points, but the player will only spawn at the one closest to the bottom right. I didn't see the point in wasting development time on limiting placements on certain tiles.<br>
