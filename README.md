### Controls

(p)lay/pause (switch from editor to game mode and back)<br>
(l)oad (the level code in the text field. MAKE SURE to click out of the field before inputting anything or else the "l" will be interpreted as part of the code. <br>
(c)opy (the code of the level you are currently designing to your clipboard. There will be NO indication, so check to make sure you have it.)<br>
<br>
Left click & drag: draw on the editor cube with the selected tile<br>
Right click & drag: rotate the editor cube<br>
1/2/3/4: Set the tool to erase / ground / spawn point / goal<br>
<br>
WASD: move (in game mode). There is no option to disable jumping at the moment, so if you wish to design a level around that, then just mention that jumping is not allowed.<br>
<br>
###Notes
v0.0 is finished and plays quite well in my opinion. However, you will most likely find bugs. If you do, report them and please, please try and find a consistent setup and adequate description.<br>
Sometimes, the cube face will "corrupt". This is very rare. You will know if it has happened if some of the tiles on the cube appear a very bright pink, the "undefined" texture. If this happens to you, please try and find a setup.<br>
You may place multiple spawn points, but the player will only spawn at the one closest to the bottom right. I didn't see the point in wasting development time on limiting placements on certain tiles.<br>
The goal will give no indication when you have reached it, it is only a texture for the moment. If a goal is placed on a wall, assume that you must stand on that wall to complete the level. No tiles can be rotated, for now.
