v0.1
 - Player can now fit through a 1 tile gap
 - Tiles may now be rotated in the editor by pressing R
 - Tidied up the GUI
 - Fixed a bug where the GUI would unload when entering play mode and then going back into edit mode
 - Pressing R in play mode now restarts the level

v0.1 fix 1
 - Tile sprites in the editor are now rotated with respect to the face they are on, rather than globally

v0.2
 - Added a new default graphics mode which will eventually support rotation animations
 - No longer render the faces which face away from the camera (performance)
 - In lite rendering mode, removed some lighting and shaders (performance)
 - Added "hollow" tile which looks like ground but has no collider (used to fill in large chunks of ground in order to save processing power)
 - Added freecam (left click & drag)
 
v0.2 fix 1
 - Removed the new rendering mode due to many issues
 - Tile rotation in the editor should work now (hopefully)
 - Made the background colors in the 2D tiles and the rendered level in the 3D tiles use sprites instead of planes to save on processing power
 - Removed the skyboxes in favor of solid colors
 
v0.2 fix 2
 - The level no longer corrupts when a non-air tile is placed in the top-left corner

v0.2 fix 3
 - Player movement speed is no longer framerate dependent
 - Stopped cameras from rendering unseen faces of the cube on lite rendering mode as well
 
v0.3
 - Going into freecam now renders every face correctly
 - Rotation of the freecam is now dependent on the rotation of the cube and player
 - Restarting the level now boots into the correct rendering mode and no longer rotates tiles in the editor

 - Gates are now visible even when inactive
 - Added notification on win
 - New editor with buttons rather than hotkeys
 - Added global rules for jump and pound allowance
 - Player can no longer pound on gates
 - Editor now supports undo/redo
 - Added four custon values for button/gate and made them swappable in the editor
 - Tiles no longer show the wrong Z rotation when exiting play mode
 - Tiles in the last block of a level code no longer lose their rotation
 - Player can no longer jump to reach a button which is five tiles above them

v0.4
 - Added crates which always fall in the same direction
 - Faces now store specific gravity and it can be changed by shift-clicking

v0.4.1 fix 2
 - Hold buttons now accept all variants
 - Physics objects no longer slide very slowly down walls

v0.4.1 fix 3
 - Physics objects no longer slide very slowly down walls (real)
 - player cannot jump off the backside of one way platforms
 - Boxes should randomly lose momentum less

v0.4.1 fix 4
 - Boxes now exhibit correct pushing mechanics

v0.4.1 fix 5
 - Platforms no longer stop working after passing over too many faces (and thus, causing small floating-point errors)

v0.4.1 fix 6
 - Portals should now correctly orient the player's velocity

v0.4.1 fix 7
 - Portals should have less jitteryness

v0.4.1 fix 8
 - Boxes should correctly preserve momentum when going through portals
 - Porals should correctly redefine hosts when pounded

v0.4.1 fix 9
 - Player controls are now briefly inverted when passing through a same-facing portal

v0.4.1 fix 10
 - Made boxes have normal friction regardless of gravity field

v0.4.1.1
 - Freecam now correctly renders faces away from the player
 - Face culling is now more processing power efficient
 - Quality slider allows user to change resolution

v0.4.1.1 fix 1
 - Portals no longer incorrectly invert controls when placed on opposite faces

v0.4.2
 - Added falling platforms which fall away from the player
 - Added the ability to push and pull boxes by holding spacebar
 - Added support for arrow keys controls

v0.4.2 fix 1
 - Falling platforms should now fall after jumping on them once rather than twice, when they have fallen before
 - Falling platforms now cannot be triggered to fall again while in motion (on a spring, free fall)
