v0.1
 - Player can now fit through a 1 tile gap
 - Tiles may now be rotated in the editor by pressing R
 - Tidied up the GUI
 - Fixed a bug where the GUI would unload when entering play mode and then going back into edit mode
 - Pressing R in play mode now restarts the level
 - Added buttons and gates which have the potential for 32 unique values but at the moment have one

v0.1 fix 1
 - Tile sprites in the editor are now rotated with respect to the face they are on, rather than globally

v0.2
 - Added a new default graphics mode which will eventually support rotation animations
 - No longer render the faces which face away from the camera (performance)
 - In lite rendering mode, removed some lighting and shaders (performance)
 - Added "hollow" tile which looks like ground but has no collider (used to fill in large chunks of ground in order to save processing power)
 - Added freecam (left click & drag)
 
v0.2 fix 1
 - Removed the new rendering mode due to many issues
 - Tile rotation in the editor should work now (hopefully)
 - Made the background colors in the 2D tiles and the rendered level in the 3D tiles use sprites instead of planes to save on processing power
 - Removed the skyboxes in favor of solid colors
 
v0.2 fix 2
 - The level no longer corrupts when a non-air tile is placed in the top-left corner

v0.2 fix 3
 - Player movement speed is no longer framerate dependent
 - Stopped cameras from rendering unseen faces of the cube on lite rendering mode as well
 
v0.3
 - Going into freecam now renders every face correctly
 - Rotation of the freecam is now dependent on the rotation of the cube and player
 - Restarting the level now boots into the correct rendering mode and no longer rotates tiles in the editor
 - Added no pound ground, anti-gate, air flag
 - Gates are now visible even when inactive
 - Added notification on win
 - New editor with buttons rather than hotkeys
 - Added global rules for jump and pound allowance
 - Player can no longer pound on gates
 - Editor now supports undo/redo
 - Added four custon values for button/gate and made them swappable in the editor
 - Tiles no longer show the wrong Z rotation when exiting play mode
 - Tiles in the last block of a level code no longer lose their rotation
 - Player can no longer jump to reach a button which is five tiles above them

v0.4
 - Added crates which always fall in the same direction
 - Faces now store specific gravity and it can be changed by shift-clicking
 - Added springs which bounce the boxes with varied force
 - Added grates which allow boxes to pass through and not the player
 - Added one-way platforms
 - Added portals which work with both boxes and the player
 - Brought back keybinds
 - Tiles now reset rotation when changing the selection
