v0.1
 - Player can now fit through a 1 tile gap
 - Tiles may now be rotated in the editor by pressing R
 - Tidied up the GUI
 - Fixed a bug where the GUI would unload when entering play mode and then going back into edit mode
 - Pressing R in play mode now restarts the level
 - Added buttons and gates which have the potential for 32 unique values but at the moment have one

v0.1 fix 1
 - Tile sprites in the editor are now rotated with respect to the face they are on, rather than globally

v0.2
 - Added a new default graphics mode which will eventually support rotation animations
 - No longer render the faces which face away from the camera (performance)
 - In lite rendering mode, removed some lighting and shaders (performance)
 - Added "hollow" tile which looks like ground but has no collider (used to fill in large chunks of ground in order to save processing power)
 - Added freecam (left click & drag)
 
v0.2 fix 1
 - Removed the new rendering mode due to many issues
 - Tile rotation in the editor should work now (hopefully)
 - Made the background colors in the 2D tiles and the rendered level in the 3D tiles use sprites instead of planes to save on processing power
 - Removed the skyboxes in favor of solid colors
 
v0.2 fix 2
 - The level no longer corrupts when a non-air tile is placed in the top-left corner
